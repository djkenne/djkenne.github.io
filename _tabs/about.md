Hi there! My name is Dave and welcome to my blog. I must say that this is long overdue and after quite a bit of procrastinating, I told myself it was time to start contributing to the open source community. So instead of just keeping technical documentation for my homelab and other side projects in private Google docs, I decided to open source them.

I hope you find this site useful for your own projects! If you see something that is wrong or could be improved, please feel free to leave a comment, or better yet [open an issue](https://github.com/djkenne/djkenne.github.io/issues/new) or [submit a PR here](https://github.com/djkenne/djkenne.github.io/pulls).

Thanks for stopping by!
