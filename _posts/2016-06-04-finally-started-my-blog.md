Well I finally started my blog...and I must say that it's been a long time coming. After quite a bit of procrastinating, I told myself it was time to stop just lurking on others people's blogs and start contributing. 

This blog is intended to give something back and open source some of the documentation I've kept for personal projects. I'm also planning on using this site for general technical notes for myself.

Previously I was just keeping my notes in private Google docs, but what good is that?! It's really not much more effort to throw up a quick blog like this; speaking of which, this is the first time I've used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and I must say I'm pretty impressed with how quickly it has come together. If you haven't already, I'd encourage you to have a look at starting your own blog using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). There's a great tutorial on the subject that you can [find here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

If you see something on the site that has helped you in some way, or you know an even better way to do something please feel free to leave some feedback in the comments section.

Thanks for stopping by and enjoy the blog!
